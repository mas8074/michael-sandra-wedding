					<h2>Our Story</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12">
					<p>This is the story of Michael and Sandy.<br>
						Long ago, in a far off land, there lived a princess.
						This princess enjoyed the simple things in life:
						Spending time with her family whom she loved so very much,
						watching her favorite rom-coms and TV shows,
						and creating edits for ABC's hit fantasy television series Once Upon A Time,
						dreaming about the day she would finally meet her Prince Charming.
						<br><br>
						Fast forward a few years and Michael and Sandy are both young college 
						students searching for companionship. Unfortunately, they are having
						trouble finding people as weird and as dorky as they are.
						So, both happen to try out the online dating app Bumble.
						<br><br>
						After only 2 short weeks of searching, Sandy matched with Michael 
						and everything started to fall into place.
						They started off with a conversation far too deep for a first impression,
						upon realizing this they immediately pivoted to a conversation about
						chicken nuggets.
						<br>
						Soon the two had made a plan to meet up (this was the first real date either had been on since joining the app, 
						so there was a lot of pressure).
						<br>
						Michael drove to meet Sandy at her sister Crystal's house for a New Year's Eve get together with her 
						sister Sarah and soon-to-be brother-in-law Zerik.
						<br><br>
						When Michael arrived, after a long, nervous drive it has to be said... 
						<br> that Michael was not expecting the person that stepped out to greet him
						to be the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.
						<br>
						<br>
						Now, there is a lot to this story. They have been together for over 4 years after all.
						If you are interested in hearing it in more detail, and yes, there is a lot more,
						feel free to ask us when you see us. We would be so happy to share it with you.
